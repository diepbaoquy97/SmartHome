# My Blog

The project is Smart home control. Its functionality is to overview and control the house, reading and set temperature, detect obstacle using motion sensor. It helps people manage home easily and safely.

# Week 11: Enclosure 
This week is about enclosure for the project. The file that I used to print the enclosure at prototype lab can find below
[EnclosureCDR](https://github.com/diepbaoquy97/SmartHome/blob/master/BaoCorel17comple.cdr).

  My closure is a case that cover the raspberry which has my MCP9808 temperature sensor inside to measure the temperature.
Here are some picture about the case

My current progress is up to date and my budget is good for now. I got everything I need so there is nothing new to buy.
# Week 10: PCB power up
This week is about PCB power up. At the first time, I soldered the temperature sensor into the PCB board. So I have to send the Gerber file to prototype lab to make a new PCB board. I got the new PCB board on Thursday and did the soldering. It works fine and can read the temperature.
Also for my buget I have got the heat sink and fan and I am going to install to my raspberry, my current buget is good and I am waiting for the socket. My current progress just catch up the plan as I scheduled.

# week 9 : PCB soldered
This week is about PCB soldering part. I got a socket and the MCP9808 temperature soldered to the PCB board.At first, by accident I soldered two pins and it connected together. Then I have to reheat it and I was success to get it seperate. Before the end of class,I checked the resistance between the VDD and Ground, there is no connection and that is a good sign. I have finished the PCB soldered milestone for this week so my current progress is on track.

Also, in my budget I need to buy the Ethernet to USB cable in order to connect the raspberry to my laptop using remote control desktop. Moreover, I have ordered a sink heat for my raspberry so It will help the raspberry work smoothly. 

I have mesesured the resistance between Vdd and Ground

# week 8: Breadboarded
My raspberry pi 4 had a problem with booting, it kept rebooting over and over again. The professor had detected the problem that there wasn't enough power to supply the raspberry. He solved the problem by plug it into USB 3.0 port ( the blue port USB) and it can boot up.

This is my circuit which connect MCP9808 temperature sensor to Raspberry. I have solder the parts of MCP9808 into the MCP9808 holes

Below is the temperature that the MCP9808 read

# Raspberry OS
I have loaded the raspberry OS into the SD card and mounted to raspberry pi. But it can't boot. I am trying to identify the issues
# Week 6: Circuit diagram
