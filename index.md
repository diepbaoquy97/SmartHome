# week 8: Breadboarded
My raspberry pi 4 had a problem with booting, it kept rebooting over and over again. The professor had detected the problem that there wasn't enough power to supply the raspberry. He solved the problem by plug it into USB 3.0 port ( the blue port USB) and it can boot up.

This is my circuit which connect MCP9808 temperature sensor to Raspberry. I have solder the parts of MCP9808 into the MCP9808 holes

Below is the temperature that the MCP9808 read

# Raspberry OS
I have loaded the raspberry OS into the SD card and mounted to raspberry pi. But it can't boot. I am trying to identify the issues
