## Introduction

This is a tutorial which help you do the measuring temperature that using temperature sensor which names MCP9808. This hardware project is used to help the software project name SmartHome. The smarthome app will have some function such as temperature reading, door status, light control. Then the app will control these hardware. This help user overview and control their house easily.

To read the temperature from MCP9808 sensor, we use Raspberry pi 4 with a SD card contain Raspian and we use Linux to write a C program to read the temperature. First, we design the PCB board and do the solder to the socket into PCB. Then we just need to plug in the Raspberry and MCP9808 sensor to the PCB board.

I use the fritzing software to design the PCB board and send it to Humber prototype lab to make the PCB board. The fritzing file could be found [here](https://github.com/diepbaoquy97/SmartHome/blob/master/BaoQuyDiep-Latest.fzz)

## Budget
For me, my budget is approximate $100. The sensor was cheap. The most money I spend is Raspberry. Below is my budget

The parts that I got later is

I also got 2 x 8 pin socket from the prototype lab
